What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little omniscum? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in PETA, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on slaughterhouses, and I have over 300 confirmed rescues. I am trained in guerilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire vegan militia. You are nothing to me but just another omniscum. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of cows, pigs and chickens across the globe and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, omnicuck. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have over 700 animal friends ready to answer my call to clean you the fuck out, as well as access to the entire arsenal of the vegan militia and I will use all of it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. My animal friends and I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking more dead than a male baby chick in a factory farm, kiddo.
